# Stats375Project3
Stuff for the third project (data analysis MLR) for MATH 375, Spring 2019.

I did a multiple linear regression analysis on some data from the USDA Feed Grains Database for MATH 375: Statistical Methods II with Dr. Wagaman at Western Carolina University. This repo contains all of the files, including data, CLEAN data that I wanted to use, R script for analysis, and my final presentation.

This is really messy because I wasn't using a reproducible workflow at the time and I have no motivation to clean up this repo right now.
